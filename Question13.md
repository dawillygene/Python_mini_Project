Step 1: Pseudocode

START
    DEFINE function get_slot_symbols()
        RETURN a list of symbols for the slot machine

    DEFINE function spin_reels()
        SELECT 3 random symbols from the slot symbols
        RETURN them as a list

    DEFINE function calculate_payout(spin_result, bet_amount)
        IF all 3 symbols are the same:
            RETURN bet_amount * 10 (Jackpot)
        ELSE IF first two symbols match:
            RETURN bet_amount * 3
        ELSE
            RETURN 0 (Loss)

    DEFINE function play_slot_machine()
        DISPLAY welcome message
        GET user balance
        LOOP while balance > 0:
            GET user's bet amount
            IF bet amount is greater than balance:
                DISPLAY "Not enough balance"
            ELSE:
                SPIN the reels
                DISPLAY spin results
                CALCULATE payout
                UPDATE balance
                ASK user if they want to play again
        DISPLAY "Game Over"

    CALL play_slot_machine()
END
